### ðŸŸ£ A: Description
- <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for binary classification where we use a logistic function, also known as a sigmoid function that takes input as independent variables and produces a probability value between 0 and 1. For example, we have two classes Class 0 and Class 1 if the value of the logistic function for an input is greater than 0.5 (threshold value) then it belongs to Class 1 it belongs to Class 0. Itâ€™s referred to as regression because it is the extension of linear regression but is mainly used for classification problems. The difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that linear regression output is the continuous value that can be anything while logistic regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not.

- <strong>Bank customer churn </strong>has become a big issue in many banks because it costs a lot more to acquire a new customer than retaining existing ones. With the use of a customer churn prediction model possible churners in a bank can be identified, and as a result the bank can take some action to prevent them from leaving.
- ### ðŸŸ£ B: About Dataset
The bank customer churn dataset is a commonly used dataset for predicting customer churn in the banking industry. It contains information on bank customers who either left the bank or continue to be a customer. The object of the dataset is to predict which customers are likely to churn, based on the input features provided. The dataset can be used for classification tasks using various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression. By predicting customer churn, banks can take appropriate measures to retain their customers and reduce customer turnover.

#### Shape of the Bank Customer Churn dataset:
The bank customer churn dataset involves 12 columns and 10000 records.

This dataset includes the following columns:

1. customer_id: A unique identifier for each customer

2. credit_score: A numerical value representing the customer's credit score

3. country: The country where the customer resides (France, Spain, Germany)

4. gender: The customer's gender (Male or Female)

5. age: The customer's age

6. tenure: The number of years the customer has been with the bank

7. balance: The customer's account balance

8. products_number: The number of bank products the customer uses (e.g., savings account, credit card)

9. credit_card: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = yes, 0 = no)

10. active_member: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = yes, 0 = no)

11. estimated_salary: The estimated salary of the customer

12. churn: Whether the customer has churned (1 = yes, 0 = no)
